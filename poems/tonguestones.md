I’m curious whether the text from that show at Pioneerworks might have somewhat inspired your initial poem on the subway? “Thoughts Unsaid / Then Forgotten." I love the prospect that it snuck into your subconscious and you weren’t thinking of it at all.

I can't find whose work it is.

Is it originally by [Bas Jan Ader](http://www.basjanader.com/)?

Or one of David Horvitz, Soda_Jerk, Joachim Koester, Elise Rasmussen, Julia Weist who were in the Tongue Stones at the Pioneerworks? Can't find exhibition webpage... 


Help!!
