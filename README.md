# poetry
A place for version controlled poetry.  

Collaborative poetry project started by Taeyoon Choi on 3.9.2015.   

From the poems that are made availiable on this repository, fork, branch, merge and make the poems your own. Let's see how the version controlled writing can help us create new kind of poetry. Code, drawings, reading and performance of the poems are also welcomed as long as the documentation can live in this repository. 

For questions, contact taeyoon at sfpc dot io.
